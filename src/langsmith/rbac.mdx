This reference explains LangSmith's Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system for managing organization-level and workspace-level permissions.

<Note>
RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) is an Enterprise feature for managing workspace-level permissions. If you are interested in this feature, [contact our sales team](https://www.langchain.com/contact-sales). Other plans default to using the Admin role for all users.
</Note>

LangSmith's RBAC system manages user permissions within workspaces. RBAC allows you to control who can access your LangSmith [workspace](/langsmith/administration-overview#workspaces) and what they can do within it.

In LangSmith, each user has:
- One [**organization role**](#organization-roles) that applies across the entire organization (separate from workspace RBAC).
    - <OrgWorkspaceRole/>
- One [**workspace role**](#workspace-roles) per workspace they're a member of (requires Enterprise RBAC feature).

On Enterprise plans, organizations can create [custom workspace roles](#custom-roles) with granular permission combinations.

To learn how to set up RBAC and assign roles to users, refer to the [User Management guide](/langsmith/user-management#set-up-access-control).

<Note>
For a comprehensive reference table of workspace-level and organization-level operations and which roles can perform them, refer to the [Organization and workspace operations reference](/langsmith/permissions-reference).

## Role types

### Organization roles

Organization roles are **distinct from the workspace RBAC feature** and are used to manage organization-wide capabilities. The roles are system-defined and cannot be modified or extended. These roles are available in multi-workspace organizations on [Plus and Enterprise plans](https://langchain.com/pricing).

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [Organization Admin](#organization-admin) | Full permissions to manage organization configuration, users, billing, and workspaces |
| [Organization User](#organization-user) | Read access to organization information and ability to create personal access tokens |
| [Organization Viewer](#organization-viewer) | Read-only access to organization information |

<Note>
In organizations limited to a single workspace, all users are [Organization Admins](#organization-admin).
</Note>

#### Organization Admin

**Description**: Full permissions to manage all organization configuration, users, billing, and workspaces.

</Note>

<Tip>
For step-by-step instructions on assigning workspace roles to users, refer to the [User Management guide](/langsmith/user-management#assign-a-role-to-a-user).
</Tip>

## Custom roles

<Info>Creating custom roles is available for organizations on the Enterprise plan.</Info>

Organization Admins can create custom roles with specific combinations of permissions tailored to their organization's needs.

### Creating custom roles

Custom roles are created at the organization level and can be assigned to users in any workspace within that organization.

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to Organization **Settings** > **Roles**.
2. Click **Create Custom Role**.
3. Select the permissions to include in the role.
4. Assign the custom role to users in specific workspaces.

For details on which specific permissions are required for each operation, refer to the [Organization and workspace operations reference](/langsmith/organization-workspace-operations).

Note the following details on custom roles:

- Custom roles can only be created and managed by Organization Admins.
- Custom roles are organization-specific (not transferable between organizations).
- Each custom role can have any combination of workspace-level permissions.
- Custom roles cannot have organization-level permissions.
- Users can have different roles (including custom roles) in different workspaces.
