This reference explains LangSmith's Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system for managing workspace-level permissions.

<Note>
RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) is an Enterprise feature for managing workspace-level permissions. If you are interested in this feature, [contact our sales team](https://www.langchain.com/contact-sales). Other plans default to using the Admin role for all users.
</Note>

LangSmith's RBAC system manages user permissions within workspaces. RBAC allows you to control who can access your LangSmith [workspace](/langsmith/administration-overview#workspaces) and what they can do within it.

Each user has:
- One [**organization role**](#organization-roles) that applies across the entire organization (separate from RBAC, available on all plans).
- One [**workspace role**](#workspace-roles) per workspace they're a member of (requires Enterprise RBAC feature).

On Enterprise plans, organizations can create [custom workspace roles](#custom-roles) with granular permission combinations.

To learn how to set up RBAC and assign roles to users, refer to the [User Management guide](/langsmith/user-management#set-up-access-control).

<Note>
For a comprehensive reference table of workspace-level and organization-level operations and which roles can perform them, refer to the [Workspace Operations Reference](/langsmith/workspace-operations).
